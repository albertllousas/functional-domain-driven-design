# functional-domain-driven-design
A pragmatic and balanced approach to combine DDD, FP, hexagonal architecture, microservices all together with Kotlin.

## Introduction TL;DR

As a developer, as many people, I've been working almost all my career in JS and java, imperative OOP and layered architectures,
in different companies and domains, for a while a though it was the way to go.

Some years ago a decided to open my mind, I learned functional programming with Scala, at least I tried, my head almost explode.
I also tried different programming languages, such as ruby, elixir, typescript or even ocaml, till finally in I fell in love
with kotlin.

One day I realised that I didn't know what the S of Solid really meant, so it led me to understand dependency-inversion
and fell in love again, this time with hexagonal architecture.

Parallel to all of that, I learned that software engineer are working not alone in a basement, we need to work together,
 so, welcome agile and [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming).

What was next? divide and conquer! microservice architectures, time to create small, autonomous and decoupled services, well I
thought I was, actually I was going more to the path of creating distributed monoliths.

Still, something was missing, that's when I was introduced to domain-driven design. Wow, how it was possible to work all
those years without paying attention to the most important thing? The business.

Nowadays DDD, both strategical and tactical, gave me an approach to follow, a way to create software focused in the business
and always trying bring value.

In this project I want to share how to put everything together, DDD, FP, hexagonal, microservices and kotlin in a complex
scenario.
