# functional-domain-driven-design
A pragmatic and balanced approach to combine DDD, FP, hexagonal architecture, microservices all together with Kotlin.

## Introduction TL;DR

As a developer, I've been working almost all my career in JS and java, imperative OOP and layered architectures,
through different companies and variety of domains.

Some years ago a decided to open my mind, I learned functional programming with Scala, at least I tried, my head almost exploded.
I also tried different programming languages, such as ruby, elixir, typescript or even ocaml, till finally in I fell in love
with kotlin .

One day I realised that I didn't know what the S of Solid really meant, so it led me to understand dependency-inversion
and fell in love again, this time with hexagonal architecture.

Parallel to all of that, I learned that software engineers should not work alone and isolated, we need to work together,
 so, welcome agile and [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming).

What was next? divide and conquer! microservice architectures, time to create small, autonomous and decoupled services, well I
thought I was, actually I was going more to the path of creating distributed monoliths.

Still, something was missing, that's when I was introduced to domain-driven design. Wow, how it was possible to work all
those years without paying attention to the most important thing? The focus on the business.

Nowadays, I still feel that I know nothing, but in this project I want to try to put everything together, DDD, FP,
hexagonal, microservices and kotlin in a real complex scenario.
